# Implement a Machine Learning Pipeline

What You'll Learn
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing your data for machine learning
- Model Training: Using a simple algorithm to train a model
- Evaluation: Measuring how well your model performs
- Prediction: Using the model to make predictions on new data

We'll use the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and tools
- `matplotlib` for visualization

# Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Before we start, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

`pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`
